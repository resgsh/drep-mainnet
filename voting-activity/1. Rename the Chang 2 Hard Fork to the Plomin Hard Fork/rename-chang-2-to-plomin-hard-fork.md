## Proposal: Rename the “Second Chang Hard Fork” to the "Plomin Hard Fork"

- **Vote**: Yes
- **Decision**: This proposal is a fitting tribute to Matthew Plomin, a respected Cardano community member. Renaming the hard fork honors his significant contributions to Cardano, especially his work on the Moneta project and the broader decentralized finance ecosystem.

  The proposal aligns with Cardano’s tradition of memorializing key contributors and reflects the community's core values of collaboration and inclusivity. Matthew’s passing in November 2024 was a loss, but renaming the hard fork to the *Plomin Hard Fork* ensures his legacy continues within the ecosystem.

- **Review**: This is a straightforward and meaningful proposal. It respectfully honors Matthew's memory and reinforces the community's commitment to supporting individuals who shape the future of Cardano.
