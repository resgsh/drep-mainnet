    "comment": "I vote YES on this governance action.\n\nThis proposal increases Plutus memory limits per transaction and per block in a careful, step-by-step manner. It helps developers build more capable smart contracts without constantly adjusting scripts to fit tight limits. This improves usability for both builders and users and supports ecosystem growth.\n\nTechnical evaluations and benchmarking indicate that the network has sufficient performance headroom. Security, block propagation time, and node stability are expected to remain within safe bounds. The change has also been deployed on testnets, which reduces uncertainty.\n\nThe update follows all constitutional guardrails, respects parameter limits, and is introduced gradually rather than as a sudden large increase. This balanced approach lowers risk while still unlocking meaningful scalability benefits.\n\nOverall, this is a well-tested and proportionate improvement that strengthens developer experience and network capacity without compromising decentralization or stability.\n"
