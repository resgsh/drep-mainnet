    "comment": "I vote Yes. This is basically housekeeping that makes the Constitution actually work better. Version 1.0 had a bunch of we encourage this and we expect that language that sounds nice but doesn't actually do anything enforceable. V2.3 cuts that fluff and focuses on what matters.\nThe Big Improvements: They're getting rid of the Budget Info Action - which was basically an extra step that slowed things down without adding much value. Instead, those important requirements just get rolled into the regular treasury withdrawal process. Simpler and still accountable. The immutability requirement is huge - once a proposal is submitted, nobody can secretly edit it later. That's just basic trust and integrity. And now ALL treasury withdrawals have to follow proper audit and accountability rules, not just the big ones. That's honestly how it should have been from the start.\nThey Actually Listened: 86% of DRep voting power reviewed version 2.0 - that's massive participation. V2.3 takes that feedback seriously and makes rational improvements based on what people actually said. The concerns about rushed discussion? They've been addressed.\nBottom Line: This isn't a radical rewrite - it's making the Constitution clearer, more consistent, and more enforceable. It removes the wishful thinking and keeps the stuff that actually protects the treasury and the community. That's a solid yes for me."
