    "comment": "I am voting YES after reviewing the full 2030 Vision, Strategy and KPI framework in detail. This proposal is not vague direction setting; it clearly defines what success means for Cardano by tying long-term goals to concrete metrics such as network reliability targets, active usage, governance participation, treasury sustainability and real-world adoption. What matters to me is that it prioritises protocol robustness, multi-client resilience, scalable UX and economic self-sufficiency before chasing growth numbers. As an Intersect OSC committee member, I have seen the depth of work, consultation and iteration that has gone into this strategy, and I am confident in Intersect’s ability to steward this framework responsibly with community oversight. This Info Action gives the ecosystem a shared reference point to make better funding, governance and product decisions over the coming years, without prematurely locking the protocol into rigid commitments.\n"
