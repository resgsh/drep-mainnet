Abstract
Following 4 weeks of active community consultation, the newly formed Cardano Govtool Consortium, made of all the community builders who actively develop the applications that make Govtool (ByronNetwork, WeDeliver, LidoNation and DQquadrant), those who use its code and APIs and individual contributors, proposes this Info Action to continue active maintenance and development of every application that makes GovTool itself, as the open-source community-owned set of tools built for public good, functioning as Cardano’s core interface for low-barrier participation in on-chain governance. As current funding concludes in June 2025, the new proposal outlines a leaner, more inclusive funding structure built to reflect community priorities.
Over the past four weeks, substantial feedback was collected, through open forums, working groups, and direct contributions, by the community members participating in the Consortium. This feedback was carefully analyzed and embedded into a tiered proposal that balances operational stability, cost efficiency, and ecosystem-wide participation. The overall direction suggested by the community, considering the clear streamlined costs and the many options to contribute in its development, is to continue for the next 12 months to actively develop and evolve these tools, expanding further its open-source structure.
With this Info Action, the Cardano Govtool Consortium aims to transparently share a revised direction and gauge broad community support. If positively received, it will enable the submission of a follow-up Treasury Withdrawal governance action to fund GovTool active development for the next 12 months.

Motivation
With CIP-1694 and the Voltaire era, Cardano governance is now in the hands of the community, but power without access is meaningless. Participation must be simple, inclusive, and equitable. GovTool provides the open, user-friendly experience needed for all Ada holders (existing and future) to register, delegate, propose, vote, and see outcomes transparently. Without it, participation risks becoming fragmented, exclusive, and dependent on closed-sourced or commercial tools, undermining decentralization. To safeguard Cardano’s democratic legitimacy, we must maintain a reliable, neutral, open-source governance set of tools, fully community-owned, non-commercial, and free to access, built as public good.



Built actively by 5 community builders, supported by many individual contributors, used by various other governance tools as basic infrastructure and by thousands of users, GovTool provides this essential infrastructure for meaningful governance.



Govtool current funding is set to expire at the end of June 2025 (the current builders have however committed their time for an extra month and Intersect committed ADA 100k to either cover critical tasks or, if this proposal is approved, to be used to incentives further individual contribution to the open repositories of these applications).



This updated proposal drafted via direct community input by the Cardano Govtool Consortium:



Reduces the total cost by almost half compared to the cost in the initial proposal
Introduces a modular, tiered funding model with flexible scope, making development and maintenance costs clear and transparent
Reinforces the decentralised structure of the Cardano Govtool and provides a clear plan to expand it to more contributors
Supports community-led development via open and open-source contribution pathways
Embeds substantial community feedback, captured through working groups, Discord discussions, submissions, public reviews and feedback sessions.
Rationale
Cardano Govtool builders have been working on these tools since before CIP-1694 was approved, overcoming the complex and new challenges of making it easy for everyone to participate in the new governance of Cardano. From helping shape on-chain governance with SanchoNet Govtool, to supporting the bootstrapping phase of governance and enabling the Chang Hard-Fork with Voltaire Govtool and finally opening access and participation to full governance by supporting the first community lead upgrade, Plomin. During this time Govtool has been used by hundreds of thousands of users, always open-sourced and built with direct contribution from the broader Cardano community. Govtool is designed to be a true open source community-owned solution, so in the past 8 weeks, and even more in the past 4 weeks, the newly formed Cardano Govtool Consortium have opened many more paths for discussion and feedback, making the inner processes more visible and easily accessible, providing more paths for participation, and collecting an incredible amount of direct insights and input on how to improve Govtool, how to further open its development and how to keep it funded for the public good.



A tier approach was proposed, discussed and refined to provide clarity and transparency on costs and options. The discussions and feedback collected indicated a strong will to continue with full active development and maintenance and expanded options for individual contributors as well as support of other open-source governance tools using Cardano’s Govtool APIs or code. This aligns with the level 3 funding outlined below (and detailed in the full length proposal)



Tiered costs:


Budget request by the Cardano Govtool Consortium: ₳1.15M ($920k) to cover 12 months of Active development and maintenance.



Level 1 – Foundational maintenance ($330K / ₳412.5K)
Covers minimum operational costs:
Infrastructure maintenance, hosting, CI/CD, and security. (0.25 FTE + hosting costs)
Core maintenance team (1 FTE QA and 1 FTE full-stack developer, split across 4 contributors to avoid downtime).
Ensures GovTool stays online, secure, and functional, but without any new features.
Level 2 – Incentivised Participation ($530K / ₳662.5K)
All in Level 1
₳150,000 to be allocated organically via direct contribution on the repos
₳100,000 to be allocated to other open source governance tools that provide new and better ways to participate in Cardano Governance leveraging (and where possible expanding) Govtool code or Govtool APIs
Level 3 – Active Development & Maintenance for each pillar ($920k - ₳1.15M)
All in level 1 (minus the $240k cost of repo maintainers which is absorbed)
All in Level 2
Accelerated growth and guaranteed monthly updates:
Funds full-time development per functional pillar:
Proposals Pillar (1 FTE)
Delegation Pillar (1.5 FTE)
Voting Pillar (1.5 FTE)
Outcomes Pillar (0.75 FTE)
Budget Discussions Pillar (0.5 FTE)
Adds dedicated end-to-end testing (1 FTE) to ensure reliability.


Any unused funds will be returned to the Cardano Treasury. Cardano Govtool project will continue to be steered through the Governance Tools Working Group, maintaining open contribution pathways for new teams and community members.


How will this budget be administered / managed


If approved, this budget will be administered by Intersect using the smart contract framework proposed
In details the budget will be distributed in:
4 smart contracts divided in monthly milestones for each of the builders submitting this proposal
1 smart contract for devOps (to be allocated via an open and transparent grant process)
2 smart contracts of ₳100k and ₳150k to be handled in the andamio platform and distributed respectively to individual contributors and to other open source governance tools that provide new and better ways to participate in Cardano Governance leveraging (and where possible expanding) Govtool code or Govtool APIs
The builders submitting this proposal are:
LidoNation > they will support the outcomes pillar
ByronNetwork > they will support the delegation and voting pillars
WeDeliver > they will support the Proposal discussion and Budget proposals pillars
DQuadrant > they will support the full end-to-end testing
The builders get direction from the Cardano Community which owns these tools via Governance Tools Working group. This effort is also currently supported by Intersect staff, not funded via this proposal, which helps facilitate and coordinate processes
Others who use Govtool APIs which will benefit from this proposal being funded and who will also access the incentives of level 2 are the builders of cardanobudget.com, 1694.io, tempo.vote, Governancespace.com, budget.cardano.africa, 1694.tools and more
