    "comment": "I’m voting YES on this proposal because it targets concrete gaps in Cardano’s ecosystem that have been holding back real adoption. This is not a generic ecosystem spend. It focuses on critical integrations that other mature ecosystems already treat as basic infrastructure, and Cardano needs them in place to compete in the next phase.\n\nThe proposal prioritises stablecoin infrastructure, pricing oracles, analytics, institutional custody, and secure cross-chain bridges. These are foundational pieces. Without reliable stablecoins and oracles, DeFi depth remains limited. Without analytics, transparency and risk assessment suffer. Without custody and compliance-ready tooling, institutional participation stays out of reach. This proposal addresses those blockers directly instead of spreading funds thinly across loosely defined initiatives.\n\nI’m also comfortable with Intersect administering the funds. Intersect has been set up specifically to represent ecosystem stakeholders and to operate with clear governance processes, reporting, and accountability. As an Intersect OSC committee member, I’ve seen the level of scrutiny applied to budgeting, delivery tracking, and transparency, and that gives me confidence that funds will be managed responsibly and in line with community expectations.\n\nThe coordinated structure here is important. Rather than multiple teams duplicating work or competing for the same integrations, this approach aligns delivery under a single framework with oversight. That reduces execution risk and increases the chance that these integrations are delivered in a usable, production-ready form.\n\nAt this stage, Cardano’s constraints are no longer at the protocol level but at the integration and ecosystem layer. Approving this proposal accelerates readiness for DeFi growth, real-world asset use cases, and institutional engagement. I don’t see anything concerning in the scope or intent of the proposal, and for these reasons, I’m confident voting YES."
