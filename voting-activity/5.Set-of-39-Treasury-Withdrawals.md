# Overall Rationale for Voting on Treasury Withdrawals

As a DRep participating in on-chain governance under the Voltaire framework, I have reviewed each of the 39 treasury withdrawal proposals currently up for vote.

This document outlines my generic voting rationale. My vote on each individual proposal-whether **Yes**, **No**, or **Abstain**-has been guided by the following considerations:

## **When I Voted Yes**

I have supported proposals that clearly satisfy all of the following:

1. **Relevance**  
   The proposal addresses a clear and meaningful need in the Cardano ecosystem-whether it is developer tooling, community infrastructure, governance, or research.

2. **Reasonableness of Budget**  
   The requested amount is proportional to the scope and deliverables. Proposals that show cost breakdowns and attempt to maximise value for money are given priority.

3. **Credibility of the Team**  
   Preference is given to teams with a proven history of delivery in the Cardano ecosystem, open-source contributions, or community engagement. In case of newer teams, supporting references or associations are considered.

4. **Alignment with Voltaire Governance Goals**  
   In the Voltaire era, legitimate, transparent use of the treasury is essential. I support proposals that help establish or strengthen governance processes and infrastructure.

## **When I Voted No or did not vote**

I have voted **No** where one or more of the above criteria are not met, such as:

- Lack of clarity or relevance to Cardano’s needs
- Justification regarding budgets
- Weak or unknown team background
- Vague deliverables or lack of public transparency

In some cases, proposals may be promising but are **premature** or **underdeveloped** at this stage.

## **When I Abstained**

I have chosen to **Abstain** when:

- The proposal shows potential but lacks enough information for a confident decision
- There are mixed signals-e.g., a good idea but poor planning, or credible team but vague milestones
- There may be overlap with other initiatives already underway

## **Summary**

This is a generic decision-making framework I have followed across all 39 proposals. Votes are cast independently for each proposal, and the default is **not Yes**. Instead, each proposal must make a clear case on its own merits.

I remain open to feedback and discussion from delegators or community members regarding any specific vote.
